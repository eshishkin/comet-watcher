# Comet Watcher

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/eshishkin/comet-watcher/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

Comet Watcher is an experimental application written using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) framework. The main purpose of the 
app is to pull data about upcoming comets from [Heavens-Above](https://heavens-above.com) and send it 
to users subscribed to such data. For now subscribers can be added via HTTP calls, however UI part is in 
development.
